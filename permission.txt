description:
This bot will auto pin attachments. It only looks for new messages, it doesn't go through history.
`!pin start` to get it to start detecting attachments to pin in a channel. `!pin stop` to get it to stop.
Goal was for stuff like art or meme channels to auto pin so that people can scroll through pins & skip discussion.
Only users with permissions to manage messages can use the bot.
